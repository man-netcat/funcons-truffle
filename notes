what exactly are value constructors?

which values are ground values? are `value-types` instances of `values` or are `values` instances of `value-types`?

why is `maps` not an algebraic datatype consisting of `map`? same applies to `sets` and `set`

types need complete overhaul, current implementation does not work (determine type parameters vs value parameters)

values need an execute function, maybe let user implement it or hardcode it

how to handle small steps for sequences? i.e. in print

figure out how frameslots work in truffle.

Fix size discrepancy in case of expressions such as else(X, Y, Z+) with + (is now 2, must be 3)
