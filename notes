what exactly are value constructors?

which values are ground values? are `value-types` instances of `values` or are `values` instances of `value-types`?

why is `maps` not an algebraic datatype consisting of `map`? same applies to `sets` and `set`

find fix for BoundedIntegersNode

types need complete overhaul, current implementation does not work (determine type parameters vs value parameters)

values need an execute function, maybe let user implement it or hardcode it

entities that don't actually change should not explicitly be assigned the same value, but this technically isn't an issue
